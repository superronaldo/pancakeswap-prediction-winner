# [HOTðŸ”¥UPDATE V2] ðŸŽ° PancakeSwap is afraid of this! This bot is a casino winner

This bot wins almost every 5 minute BNB-USD option on PancakeSwap Prediction.

Now it works with PancakePredictionV2.

[Update 2.2]: Now supports Strategy Choice (start the bot with `--exp` flag)

[Update 2.1]: Now supports [Candle Genie](https://candlegenie.io/prediction) BTC Price Option

#### Beware of forks. I do not give any guarantee that the fork may turn out to be a scam.

### I'm coding this stuff on a pure open source, so you have 2 options: either you share the profit with me through donation, or the bot starts taking money from you. These are the laws of the Universe. ðŸ¤¡
